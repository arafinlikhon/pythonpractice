1. Write a Python program to convert degrees to radians.
Note : The radian is the standard unit of angular measure, used in many areas of mathematics. An angle's measurement in radians is numerically equal to the length of a corresponding arc of a unit circle; one radian is just under 57.3 degrees (when the arc length is equal to the radius).
Test Data:
Degree : 15
Expected Result in radians: 0.2619047619047619
